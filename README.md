**Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)** is a critical public health challenge in Africa with significant global implications for health, security, and the economy. Unaddressed, AMR has the potential to cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050. AMR arises when bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites develop resistance to treatments, making infections increasingly difficult to treat. Challenges such as inadequate healthcare infrastructure, overuse of antibiotics, and weak regulatory systems hinder the fight against AMR in Africa. However, opportunities for mitigation exist through strengthening surveillance systems, improving antimicrobial stewardship programs, and fostering international collaboration. **Addressing these challenges** is essential for controlling AMRâ€™s impact on both human and animal health and contributing to global efforts to safeguard public health and economic stability.
