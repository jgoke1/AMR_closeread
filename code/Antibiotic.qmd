@cr-face_off **Antimicrobial resistance (AMR)** has been acknowledged as one of the top ten public health threats facing humanity. It is a complex and multidimensional problem, threatening not only human and animal health, but also regional, national, and global security, and the economy. O'Neil's 2014 report projected that AMR will cause 10 million deaths annually by 2050 and will result in between 2% to 3.5% less in gross domestic product (GDP), if not adequately and urgently addressed.

# Understanding Antimicrobial Resistance

[@cr-AMR]{scale-by=".7"} **Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR)** occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to antimicrobial medicines [WHO](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance).

[@cr-AMR]{scale-by=".7"} As a result of drug resistance, antibiotics and other antimicrobial medicines become ineffective and infections become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness, disability and death.

[@cr-AMR]{scale-by=".7"} AMR is a natural process that happens over time through genetic changes in pathogens. Its emergence and spread is accelerated by human activity, mainly the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials to treat, prevent or control infections in humans, animals and plants.



# Global Concern

@cr-global The report by the Global Research on Antimicrobial Resistance (GRAM) project estimated that 4.95 million deaths were associated globally with bacterial resistance in 2019 and, of these, 1.27 million deaths were directly attributable to resistance [Christopher *et al*., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35065702/). The consequences of AMR are more calamitous in low to middle-income countries (LMICs) and their development agenda due to the occurrence of more prevalent infectious diseases.

| Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major problem in the African region in the year 2019.
| More than a million fatalities were associated with AMR, with an additional 250,000 being directly caused by it.
| Infections of the lungs and chest, the bloodstream, the abdomen, 
| and tuberculosis were the leading causes of death in this group of patients [Satoris *et al.*, 2023](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00539-9/fulltext).
:::



Most of these fatalities were caused by four specific bacteria **Streptococcus pneumoniae**, **Klebsiella pneumoniae**, **Escherichia coli**, and **Staphylococcus aureus**accounted for more than 100,000 deaths each [Satoris *et al.*, 2023](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(23)00539-9/fulltext).


@cr-map Examining a glimpse of Antimicrobial resistance trends in Africa using the ATLAS dataset ([Pfizer-Antimicrobial Testing Leadership and Surveillance](https://www.atlas-surveillance.com/#/login)). 

@cr-map Due to limits attributed to various countries, only a small amount of data is submitted, and the data does not accurately represent the region (just 13 African countries are participating).

# Focus on the ESKAPE

@cr-species **ESKAPE** is the WHO adopted acronyms for the **six** priority pathogens in Africa, and they are **Escherichia coli**, **Staphyloccus aureus**, **Klebsiella pneumoniae**, **Actinobacter baumanii**, **Pseudomonas auregenosa**, **Enterobacter species** 

@cr-Ecoli **Escherichia coli** The majority of E. coli strains are benign; nonetheless, pathogenic variants can lead to severe foodborne illness, septic shock, meningitis, or urinary tract infections in humans.In contrast to non-pathogenic E. coli, pathogenic strains generate toxins and several virulence factors that allow them to occupy areas of the body often unoccupied by E. coli, thereby inflicting damage on host cells. These harmful characteristics are encoded by virulence genes exclusively possessed by the pathogens.

@cr-staph **Staphyloccus aureus**  has long been acknowledged as one of the most significant pathogenic bacteria in humans. It is the primary cause of skin and soft tissue infections, including abscesses, furuncles, and cellulitis. While the majority of staphylococcal infections are benign, S. aureus has the potential to induce severe conditions, including bloodstream infections, pneumonia, and infections of the bones and joints.

@cr-kleb **Klebsiella pneumoniae** is a gram-negative bacterium that can cause severe infections, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems. Common infections include pneumonia, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infections (sepsis), and liver abscesses. Associated with hospital-acquired infections, often linked to invasive devices like ventilators or catheters. It is also rampant in the cause of death of neonates(0-2 months old).[Jenifer *et al*., 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38218193/)

@cr-baumanii **Acinetobacter baumannii** is a gram-negative, opportunistic pathogen that is responsible for severe healthcare-associated infections, such as ventilator-associated pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound infections, and meningitis. Its pathogenicity is ascribed to its capacity to form biofilms, and produce toxins. It thrives in hospital settings, which presents a challenge to the treatment and management of infections. 

@cr-baumanii The burden of *A. baumannii* is substantial in Africa, particularly in intensive care units (ICUs). According to a systematic review, *A. baumannii* is responsible for approximately 3.6% of all hospital infections in Africa, with multiple drug resistance rates spanning from 77% to 87%. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant *A. baumannii* is estimated to be 20% in sub-Saharan Africa [Nicholas *et al*., 2023](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/tropical-diseases/articles/10.3389/fitd.2023.1110125/).

@cr-Enterobacter **Enterobacter species** are opportunistic bacteria that are particularly prevalent in hospital environments and can cause a variety of infections, including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, bloodstream infections, and surgical site infections. They are resistant to antibiotics due to their ability to produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and form biofilms.

@cr-Enterobacter *Enterobacter* species are becoming increasingly problematic in Africa as a result of elevated levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A review revealed that AMR in *Enterobacterales* is prevalent in sub-Saharan Africa, which contributes to sepsis and increased mortality [Kowalski *et al*., 2024](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38495519/). 

@cr-Pseudo **Pseudomonas aeruginosa** is an opportunistic pathogen associated with a range of infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals. The pathogenicity is due to various virulence factors, such as biofilm formation, elastase production, and toxin secretion that harm host tissues. P. aeruginosa is associated with a range of infections, such as dermatitis, soft tissue infections, bone and joint infections, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, respiratory infections, and systemic infections. 

@cr-Pseudo Research in Africa has emphasised the genetic diversity and antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa strains. Research conducted in Kenya has documented the distribution and genomic characteristics of clinical P. aeruginosa strains, highlighting the challenges associated with treating infections caused by this bacterium [Kiyaga *et al*., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35369511/).

@cr-challenge **Questionable Quality Assurance**
Many African countries face challenges with regulating the quality of medicines. Substandard and counterfeit drugs, including antibiotics, are prevalent due to weak pharmaceutical oversight, leading to ineffective treatment and resistance development.

@cr-challenge **Weak Laboratory Infrastructure**
Limited laboratory facilities, outdated equipment, and a lack of diagnostic tools impede effective detection and monitoring of AMR. Many rural and underserved areas have no access to diagnostic services, making data collection and treatment monitoring difficult.


@cr-challenge **Limited Staff and Training Capacity**
Africa faces a critical shortage of healthcare professionals trained in AMR-related areas. Medical personnel, microbiologists, and laboratory technicians often lack the expertise needed to detect and respond effectively to resistance patterns.


@cr-challenge **Communication Issues**
There are significant gaps in communication between governments, healthcare providers, and the public. This leads to poor coordination in AMR interventions and limited awareness campaigns to educate communities about the dangers of improper antibiotic use.

@cr-challenge **Limited Availability of Consumables, Diagnostics, and Reagents**
Essential supplies such as diagnostic kits, reagents, and microbial culture media are either expensive or unavailable. This shortage hampers the ability of health systems to diagnose infections and track AMR trends accurately.

@cr-challenge **Reliance on External Funding**
Many African nations rely heavily on donor funding to finance AMR surveillance, research, and intervention programs. This dependence creates gaps when external funding is withdrawn, limiting the sustainability of these efforts.

@cr-challenge **Data Gaps** Reliable data on AMR trends are often limited due to inconsistent or incomplete reporting.

@cr-P7 In response to the threat of AMR in the context of the One Health approach, in 2015 the World Health Organization (WHO) endorsed a Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR that serves as a blueprint for country-specific National Action Plans (NAPs). One of the objectives highlighted in both the GAP and country NAPs is the need to improve awareness and understanding of antimicrobial resistance through effective communication, education, and training, the umbrella for the other four strategic objectives.

@cr-glass **The Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS)**, led by WHO, helps African countries monitor AMR trends, strengthen labs, and guide policies using standardized data. Despite challenges, nations like South Africa and Kenya lead efforts, fostering collaboration, enhancing stewardship, and contributing to global strategies against antimicrobial resistance. 

@cr-P3 **WORLD ANTIMICROBIAL AWARENESS WEEK (WAAW)**

@cr-P3 As a result of the rise in resistant bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites, there is increasing worldwide concern about the abuse and overuse of antimicrobials. Consequently, there is a week set aside each year to educate the public on the dangers of overusing antibiotics.

@cr-P5 The idea for a dedicated awareness week was championed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners as part of a larger global action plan to combat antimicrobial resistance. 

@cr-P5 WAAW was first launched in 2015 following the adoption of the Global Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance by the WHO Member States at the World Health Assembly in May of the same year. The initiative marked a significant milestone in global health, recognizing that coordinated action across countries and sectors was essential to address this pressing challenge.
